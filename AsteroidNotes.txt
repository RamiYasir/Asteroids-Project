Gravity (compisite with Asteroid and maybe Ship)
HandleInput (composite with Ship)

//can rotate to a certain angle.
        //keep track of which direction the ship is facing? Maybe as an enum?
        //then a helper function called "rotate ship" which takes the direction to 
        //face and animates its movement in relation to the direction we already have. 
        
        //or, somehow keep track of the "nose" point. Somehow convert this into a positive or negative number
        //within a range and assign it to this.direction.


I know the thing is 600 x 400. If I add the coordinates together, highest I can get is 

//actually, maybe convert this to polar coordinates instead. 

//or i could take two coordinates, the nose and the point opposite it, on the tail end. If i minus the tail set of points
from the nose set, I could get a rough direction. 

//OR, could take the previous set of coordinates and the current set of coordinates and figure out the direction of movement
from there.

//use count of left or right keypressed events as a time indicator. 

//If i take the previous position from the current one, I get a velocity.
